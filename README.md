[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/placeholder/beyond-scaling)](https://beyondscaling.netlify.app)

## üß† Interactive AI & Neuroscience Research Visualization

This repository contains an interactive web-based visualization of cutting-edge research on the integration of neuroscience principles into AI development. The project explores how neuroscience-inspired approaches are helping AI move beyond the traditional scaling paradigm.

## üîç Key Features

- **Interactive Flowchart**: Visual representation of the relationships between traditional AI approaches, neuroscience principles, and next-generation AI systems.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Radar chart comparing traditional scaling approaches with neuroscience-inspired methods across multiple dimensions.
- **Historical Timeline**: Interactive timeline showing the evolution of AI approaches from 2020-2025.
- **Expandable Research Sections**: Detailed breakdowns of three core neuroscience frameworks: Free Energy Principle, Metastability, and Embodied Consciousness.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark viewing modes for comfortable reading.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on desktop and mobile devices.

## üî¨ Research Framework

The website details three fundamental neuroscience frameworks that are driving innovation beyond traditional scaling approaches:

1. **The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference** (Karl Friston)
   - Describes the brain as an adaptive system that minimizes uncertainty
   - Active inference as an action-perception loop
   - Applications in the SOLOMON Framework (IBM & MIT, 2025)

2. **Metastability: Beyond Critical States** (Scott Kelso)
   - Balance between integration and segregation in neural processing
   - Flexible transitions between different processing regimes
   - Applications in new neural network architectures

3. **Embodied Consciousness** (Anil Seth)
   - Consciousness emerging from embodied, self-organized systems
   - Sensorimotor grounding and biological imperatives
   - Applications in physical common sense models

## üíª Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) for flowchart visualization
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for radar charts
- Web animations and transitions
